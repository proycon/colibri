EXPERIMENT LOG
----------------------



Alignment experiments:
		2012-03											- EM-IBM1 followed by graph adjustment of weights according to subsumption relations) -> unexpected and significant negative impact 
		2012-04    	- europarl25k-nl-en-EMexp/EMExp3	- EM-IBM1 with inclusion of null model (1 NULL position in source sentence) -> negligable impact (slightly positive, expected more though)
		2012-04											- EM-IBM1 on type rather than sentence basis -> complete failure, bad idea
		2012-04-27  - europarl25k-nl-en-EMexp2  		- EM-IBM1 initialised with a Jaccard run rather than uniform initialisation -> positive impact
		2012-04-28  - europarl25k-nl-en-experimental	- considering multiple occurrences of types in the same sentence pair (EM-IBM1) -> unexpected slightly NEGATIVE effect
		2012-04 	- europarl25k-nl-en-EMexp/EMExp2/3	- best-n thresholding compared to P thresholding -> 'well-picked' P values have more effect
		2012-04		- europarl25k-nl-en-EMexp3			- EM-IBM1 with best-n thresholding, at increasingly higher values (i.e. less pruning) -> slightly positive impact, even at b20, 40   
	
		2012-05		- europarl25k-nl-en-EMexp4			- Different iterations of EM-IBM1 -> RUNNING
		2012-05		- europarl25k-nl-en-EMexp2b			- Overall EM-IBM1 test with lowest pattern-finding threshold (t2), including Jaccard initialisation, best-n thresholding -> RUNNING
