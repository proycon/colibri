Alignment experiments:
	EM experiments (MT evaluation with moses):
		2012-03											- Graph model (post-alignment adjustment of weights according to subsumption relations) -> unexpected and significant negative impact 
		2012-04    	- europarl25k-nl-en-EMexp3 - 		- inclusion of null model (1 NULL position in source sentence) -> negligable impact (slightly positive, expected more though)
		2012-04											- EM on type rather than sentence basis -> complete failure, bad idea
		2012-04-27  - europarl25k-nl-en-EMexp2  		- EM initialised with a Jaccard run rather than uniform initialisation -> positive impact
		2012-04-28  - europarl25k-nl-en-experimental	- considering multiple occurrences of types in the same sentence pair (EM) -> unexpected slightly NEGATIVE effect
		2012-04		- europarl25k-nl-en-EMexp3			- EM with best-n thresholding, at increasingly higher values (i.e. less pruning) -> slightly positive impact, even at b20, 40
